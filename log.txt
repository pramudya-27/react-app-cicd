The following "npm" command (if executed) installs the "cross-env"
dependency into the local "node_modules" directory, which will ultimately
be stored in the Jenkins home directory. As described in
https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/install, the "--save-dev" flag causes the
"cross-env" dependency to be installed as "devDependencies". For the
purposes of this tutorial, this flag is not important. However, when
installing this dependency, it would typically be done so using this
flag. For a comprehensive explanation about "devDependencies", see
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18875674/whats-the-difference-between-dependencies-devdependencies-and-peerdependencies.

The following "npm" command tests that your simple Node.js/React

runner Jest (https://facebook.github.io/jest/).

Ran all test suites.
Jest did not exit one second after the test run has completed.

This usually means that there are asynchronous operations that weren't stopped in your tests. Consider running Jest with `--detectOpenHandles` to troubleshoot this issue.
[0;33mOne of your dependencies, babel-preset-react-app, is importing the

The following "npm" command runs your Node.js/React application in
development mode and makes the application available for web browsing.
The "npm start" command has a trailing ampersand so that the command runs
as a background process (i.e. asynchronously). Otherwise, this command
can pause running builds of CI/CD applications indefinitely. "npm start"
is followed by another command that retrieves the process ID (PID) value
of the previously run process (i.e. "npm start") and writes this value to
the file ".pidfile".
